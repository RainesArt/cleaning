# Data Cleaning
<p>Hello EC*REACH Analyst! Your first data assignment will be to pull the synthetic data do file from the main branch and run it on your machine. <b> Please note that each time you run the do file, you may get a different result</b> After running the do file, please take some time to analyze the data. Please run summary statistics on variables getting means, medians, and standard deviations. Please also look to explain the data errors you see. For example, does one variable have a high amount of missingness? What issues might that pose? What solution might you have for dealing with the variable, if any? Lastly, please create additional variables. I would like you to create an address variable that assigns an address to each observation, a family id variable that assigns a family id based on last name and address, a verbal skills variable that assigns a value between 0-15, and a race variable that assigns White, Black, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, Middle Eastern, Native American, or Other to an observation.
</p>

  Please also look to create small graphics to represent the data. It is up to you to choose which variable(s) you would like to use. You may also attempt to create a small prediction algorithm of student test scores and other factors like race.
